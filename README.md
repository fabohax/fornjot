# XRIO Kernel

**XRIO** (Xtensible Rust Infrastructure for Objectification) is a geometry kernel for CAD and modeling systems, written in Rust and originally forked from [Fornjot](https://github.com/hannobraun/fornjot). XRIO builds on Fornjot's solid B-Rep foundation and takes it further by aiming at extensible, programmatic, and web-oriented applications.

---

## Project Scope

XRIO continues Fornjot’s mission of creating a reliable and modular boundary representation (B-Rep) CAD kernel, while introducing:

- Broader interoperability across 3D ecosystems (CAD, GIS, XR, fabrication)
- WebAssembly compatibility for browser-native CAD workflows
- High modularity for programmatic geometry workflows
- Infrastructure for objectification—serialization, provenance, constraints, and editing

---

## Status

XRIO is an early-stage geometry kernel. Core topological and geometric abstractions are in active design. This project is in **exploration phase**, ideal for contributors passionate about foundational CAD, Rust, or geometric computing.

---

## Contributing

XRIO welcomes contributors interested in:

* Geometric kernel architecture
* Procedural and constraint-based modeling
* CAD file format support
* Mathematical and spatial computation
* Real-time rendering and WASM deployment

Start by reviewing open issues or suggesting improvements via discussion or pull request.
